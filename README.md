# DSA Visual Learning Project

## 📘 Description
This project is part of my virtual learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It covers key foundational concepts in a visual and interactive format to help students better understand how data structures work internally.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- ✅ Arrays
- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- ✅ Stacks (Push, Pop, Peek operations)
- ✅ Queues (Enqueue, Dequeue, Priority queues)
- ✅ Trees (Binary Trees, Tree traversal)

## 🎯 Objective
To simplify DSA concepts using visuals and step-by-step logic. Ideal for beginners, school students, and anyone curious about how data structures work.

## 🏠 Homepage
From the **Homepage**, you can access all the pages and visualizations for:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees

All sections are interconnected and accessible with clean navigation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/manojkothakota/DATA-STRUCTURE
